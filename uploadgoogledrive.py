"""
Upload Folders to Specific Google Drive Locations using rclone
Author: Juan David Lamus Rinc√≥n

This script reads a list of folder names and associated Google Drive links from an Excel file,
then uploads each folder to the correct Drive destination using rclone.

Note: You must configure your rclone remote (e.g. "drive_unidad") before running the script.
